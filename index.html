		<p>The mission of the ActivitySim project is to create and maintain advanced, open-source, activity-based travel behavior modeling software based on best software development practices for distribution at no charge to the public. The ActivitySim project is led by a consortium of Metropolitan Planning Organizations (MPOs), Departments of Transportation (DOTs), and other transportation planning agencies. The consortium provides technical direction and resources to support project development. All member agencies make an annual contribution to the effort and help to make decisions about development priorities. New member agencies are welcome to join the consortium. To learn more about joining the consortium, <a href="mailto:activitysim@ampo.org">contact us</a>.</p>
